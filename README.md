# Deployment Pipeline and Cloud Platforms


### Project Overview


This project introduces you to the core concepts of CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and deploying to cloud platforms. You'll learn how to automate software delivery processes, manage releases, and deploy applications efficiently.

Whether you're a beginner or looking to reinforce your DevOps skills, this project covers foundational practices and practical implementation using GitHub Actions.

### Lesson 1: Introduction to Deployment Pipelines


#### Objectives

- Understand stages of a deployment pipeline.


- Learn various deployment strategies.


(1) **Deployment Pipeline Stages**

(i) Development – Write and test code locally.

(ii) Integration – Merge code into a shared branch.

(iii) Testing – Run automated tests to verify code quality.

(iv) Staging – Deploy to a production-like environment for final checks.

(v) Production – Release to end-users.

(2) **Deployment Strategies**

(i) **Blue-Green Deployment** – Switch between two environments for zero-downtime releases.

(ii) **Canary Releases** – Gradually expose new features to subsets of users.

(iii) **Rolling Deployment** – Incrementally replace old instances with new versions.

### Lesson 2: Automated Releases and Versioning

#### Objectives

- Automate versioning during CI/CD.

- Manage releases using GitHub Actions.

(i) **Automated Versioning**
Follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer) format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

(ii) **Use GitHub Actions to automate version bumps and tagging.**

Example: Automatic Version Bump and Tag

yaml

Copy

Edit

name: Bump version and tag

on:

  push:

    branches:
      - main

jobs:

  build:

    name: Create Tag
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Bump version and push tag
      uses: anothrNick/github-tag-action@1.26.0
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        DEFAULT_BUMP: patch
Automated Releases
- Create releases automatically when new tags are pushed:

yaml

Copy

Edit

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

jobs:

  build:

    name: Create Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Create Release
      uses: actions/create-release@v1
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
        release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}


### Lesson 3: Deploying to Cloud Platforms


#### Objectives

- Automate deployment to cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP).

-Configure deployment environments using GitHub Actions.

Step-by-Step Guide
1. Choose a Cloud Platform
AWS

Azure

Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

2. ### Configure GitHub Actions

Example Workflow for AWS Deployment

yaml
Copy
Edit
name: Deploy to AWS

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up AWS credentials
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
      with:
        aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        aws-region: us-west-2

    - name: Deploy to AWS
      run: |
        aws s3 sync ./dist s3://your-bucket-name


3. ### Deployment Environment Configuration

- Store sensitive keys in GitHub Secrets.

- Use environment-specific workflows for Dev, Staging, and Production.

### Troubleshooting and Resources


- Review GitHub Actions logs for error details.

- Use YAML Lint for YAML validation.
